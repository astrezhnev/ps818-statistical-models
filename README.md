# PS 818: Data Analysis with Statistical Models ("MLE") (Fall 2025)

## Course description

This course is part of the second year of the quantitative methods sequence and builds on the material covered in the first year. It will introduce students to likelihood and Bayesian inference with a focus on multilevel/hierarchical regression models and conclude with a review of modern machine learning methods for flexible estimation of regression models. The overarching framework of this class is model-based inference for description and prediction -- a complement to the design-based framework of causal inference. We will discuss, however, how to incorporate predictive models into a causal inference workflow, particularly when adjusting for confounding in selection-on-observables designs. Students will learn both the theory behind Bayesian modeling as well as how to implement common estimators (e.g. Expectation-Maximization, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)) in the R statistical programming language. They will also be exposed to techniques such as random forests and kernel ridge regression/gaussian process regression among others. Applied examples will be drawn from across the political science literature, with a particular emphasis on the analysis of large survey data (e.g. the American National Election Survey (ANES), the Cooperative Election Survey (CES), the European Social Survey (ESS)).

This repository is used to distribute course materials: slides, assignments and datasets

I recommend setting up a Github account and cloning the repository on your local machine. [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) provides a relatively easy-to-use GUI interface to interacting with Git.

# Readings and assignment submissions

Readings will be posted on the course's Canvas site - You should also submit your assignments and exams there.
